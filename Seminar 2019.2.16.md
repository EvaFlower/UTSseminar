## Introduction  
### What is generative models?
Generative models learn to capture the statistical distribution of training data, allowing us to synthesize samples
from the learned distribution. It has two types of probabilistic models: prescribed and implicit models.  
GAN belongs to implicit generative models.  
  
  
## GAN
### Model of GAN
In [1], it has discussed several approaches in implicit generative models and analyzed GAN under these approaches.  
Based on that, we will discuss GAN in:  
1) Class Probability Estimation  
2) Divergence Minimisation  
3) Ratio Matching  
4) Moment Matching  
 
### Problems of GAN
#### Objective Function
1) Define it and analyze it based on [2]
2) Discuss work in [3] based on [4]
#### Mode Collapse [5]
1) Why?
2) Existing proposed ideas to solve it
